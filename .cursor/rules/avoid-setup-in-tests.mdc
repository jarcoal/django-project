# Avoid setUp and setUpTestData in Tests

When writing tests, prefer creating test data directly within each test method rather than using `setUp` or `setUpTestData`. This approach makes tests more explicit, easier to understand, and reduces hidden dependencies between tests.

## Do ✅

```python
# Good: Data creation directly in the test
class TestOrderProcessing(TestCase):
    def test_order_processing(self):
        supplier = SupplierFactory()
        product = ProductFactory(
            supplier=supplier,
            unit_price=10.00,
            units_in_stock=100
        )
        order = OrderFactory(items=[product])
        
        result = process_order(order)
        self.assertEqual(result.status, "processed")

    def test_invalid_order(self):
        product = ProductFactory(
            unit_price=10.00,
            units_in_stock=0  # Out of stock
        )
        order = OrderFactory(items=[product])
        
        with self.assertRaises(ValidationError):
            process_order(order)
```

## Don't ❌

```python
# Bad: Using setUp for data creation
class TestOrderProcessing(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.supplier = SupplierFactory()
        self.product = ProductFactory(
            supplier=self.supplier,
            unit_price=10.00
        )
        self.order = OrderFactory(items=[self.product])
    
    def test_order_processing(self):
        result = process_order(self.order)
        self.assertEqual(result.status, "processed")
    
    def test_invalid_order(self):
        self.product.units_in_stock = 0  # Modifying shared test data!
        with self.assertRaises(ValidationError):
            process_order(self.order)

# Bad: Using setUpTestData for shared data
class TestOrderProcessing(TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpTestData(cls):
        cls.supplier = SupplierFactory()
        cls.product = ProductFactory(
            supplier=cls.supplier,
            unit_price=10.00
        )
        cls.order = OrderFactory(items=[cls.product])
```

## Guidelines

1. Create test data directly within each test method
2. Only use `setUp` for truly shared setup that isn't test data (like configuring test clients or mocking external services)
3. Avoid using `setUpTestData` for creating test data
4. Each test should be self-contained and not rely on data created in other tests
5. If you find yourself repeating data creation across many tests, consider creating helper methods within the test class
6. The only exception to this rule is when you have a large dataset that is truly shared across all tests and would be expensive to recreate for each test

## Benefits

1. **Explicit Dependencies**: Each test clearly shows what data it needs
2. **Easier Debugging**: When a test fails, you don't need to look elsewhere to understand the test data
3. **Test Isolation**: Tests are truly independent and can't affect each other through shared state
4. **Better Readability**: The test's setup is immediately visible in the test method
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to one test's data setup won't affect other tests

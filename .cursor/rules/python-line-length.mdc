# Python Line Length

Maximum line length is 88 characters for comments and docstrings (Black formatter will handle code).

## Do ✅

```python
# Good: Folding long comments to next line
# This is a very long comment that should be folded to the next line when it
# reaches the maximum length of 88 characters

# Good: Using noqa only for code that can't be formatted below 88 chars
def get_very_long_docstring(
    param1,
    param2,
    param3,
    param4,
    param5,
    param6,
    param7,
    param8,
):  # noqa: E501
    """This is a very long docstring that exceeds the maximum length and needs a noqa comment."""
    pass
```

## Don't ❌

```python
# Bad: Using noqa for comments that can be folded
# This is a very long comment that should be folded to the next line when it reaches the maximum length of 88 characters  # noqa: E501
```

## Guidelines

1. Maximum line length is 88 characters for comments and docstrings
2. Let Black formatter handle code line length
3. Fold long comments and docstrings to the next line
4. Only use `# noqa: E501` for code that cannot be formatted below 88 characters

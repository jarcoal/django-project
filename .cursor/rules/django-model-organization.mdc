# Django Model Organization

New models go in `app/models/` and must be registered in `__init__.py`.

## Do ✅

```python
# Good: models/email.py
from django.db import models

class EmailMessage(models.Model):
    message_id = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    # ... rest of model definition

# Good: models/__init__.py
from .email import EmailMessage

__all__ = ['EmailMessage']
```

## Don't ❌

```python
# Bad: Model defined in models.py
# models.py
from django.db import models

class EmailMessage(models.Model):
    message_id = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    # ... rest of model definition

# Bad: Model not registered in __init__.py
# models/email.py
from django.db import models

class EmailMessage(models.Model):
    message_id = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    # ... rest of model definition
```

## Guidelines

1. Place new models in `app/models/` directory
2. Each model should be in its own file (e.g., `models/email.py`)
3. Register all models in `models/__init__.py`
4. Use `__all__` to explicitly define which models are exported
